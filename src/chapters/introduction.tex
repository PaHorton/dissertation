\section{Motivation and Background}
Mission operations are one of the most critical aspects of any space mission.
They involve the planning, execution, and monitoring of all activities to ensure science goals are met and the safety of the instrument is maintained.
With complex instruments and larger data volumes becoming common, mission operations have become increasingly challenging.
Missions such as the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) \parencite{horton2021integrating}, the Roman Space Telescope (RST) \parencite{horton2024anomaly}, and the Astrophysics Stratospheric Telescope for High Spectral Resolution Observations at Submillimeter-wavelengths (ASHTORS) \parencite{horton2024board} have a demonstrated need to quickly analyze data in order to meet the ever-shrinking operation timelines of modern space missions \parencite{wilson2017nasa}.
This demand for rapid tactical decision-making in bandwidth-constrained environments has led to the need for more efficient ways to review and analyze data.

Traditional data analysis approaches often rely on manual inspection or, in the case of bandwidth-limited systems, random sampling of data to identify potential issues or spot novel features.
When looking for unexpected and uncharacterized phenomena, these approaches can be inefficient and time-consuming as it is easy to overlook important features without a systematic approach.
Novelty detection is particularly well suited for this task as it does not rely on a priori knowledge of what constitutes an anomaly, simply that there is a set of data that is representative of the expected behavior of the system that can be used to measure how well new data matches this expected behavior \parencite{japkowicz1995novelty}.
This need for rapid anomaly detection has led to the development of new methods and techniques that can quickly identify unexpected features in data, allowing for more efficient mission operations \parencite{kerner2020comparison}.
While much of the work in this area is focused on the development of new algorithms and techniques, there is also a need for more efficient ways to implement these methods in practice.
This is where the use of modern software engineering practices and tools can play a critical role.

\section{Research Objectives}
The primary goal of this dissertation is to develop a framework for data prioritization that allows mission operations teams to quickly triage targets for analysis and review.
Novelty detection is a key component of this framework, as it allows for the identification of unexpected features without prior knowledge of what constitutes an anomaly.
Not being reliant on prior knowledge gives novelty detection the versatility to be applied to a wide range of data types and mission scenarios.
For our domains of interest, I focused on the use of novelty detection to identify features in multispectral images from Mastcam on MSL \parencite{horton2021integrating}, snowballs and cosmic rays on RST's Wide Field Instrument (WFI) \parencite{horton2024anomaly}, and finally anomalous spectra on ASTHROS \parencite{horton2024board}.
In addition to these being scientifically different domains, these three instruments differ in their operational domains, MSL is a currently operational mission analyzing data while in the field, RST is a future mission using data collected during integration and testing to identify potential issues, and ASTHROS is also a future mission but has the goal of performing this analysis on-board the instrument.

ASTHROS, shown in Figure \ref{intro/fig:asthros}, is a major component of this dissertation as it is the ideal platform to develop a complete end-to-end system with the implementation of on-board novelty detection in mind. 
ASTHROS is a scientific ballooning mission that gives us the opportunity to perform high spectral resolution observations at submillimeter wavelengths from the stratosphere \parencite{siles2020asthros}.
Ballooning literally gives astronomers a much higher vantage point to observe than ground-based telescopes by allowing us to get above the majority of the atmosphere; which is a major source of noise in submillimeter observations \parencite{yajima2009scientific}.
Figure \ref{intro/fig:atmosphere} shows the atmospheric opacity at various wavelengths, with the submillimeter wavelengths (100-1000 $\mu$m) being completely opaque from the ground.

This higher vantage point is not without its drawbacks, however, as communication with the instrument has limited bandwidth and latency. 
Because of this, ballooning missions store all of their data on board the instrument and only send back samples of the data for diagnostic purposes.
When the balloon lands, the instrument is recovered, and the hard drives are read to review the full dataset \parencite{walker_STO}.
This makes ballon-borne missions an ideal candidate for on-board novelty detection, as I can use the limited bandwidth to send only the most diagnostically relevant data back to the ground for review.
In our case, this data differs from the expected behavior of the instrument, which is what novelty detection is designed to identify.

ASTHROS, being in its early stages of development, also made it an ideal candidate for me as a graduate student to develop a complete end-to-end system.
This allowed me to work closely with the instrument team to develop a system that meets their needs and can be integrated into the instrument's operations.
Developing this system allowed me to utilize all aspects of my background; from my Software Engineering and Applied Physics degrees to my growth as a scientist and engineer during my Ph.D program.
Figure \ref{intro/fig:asthros_instrument} shows my vantage point in developing this instrument as I sat front and center controlling every aspect of the instrument's software. 
I played a critical role in the development of the instrument's software, operating as an integral part in the development of the low-level hardware control as well as the high-level data analysis and visualization tools.
My objective in all this was to develop a system that functionally met the science goals of the mission while also giving me a platform to integrate novelty detection into the instrument's operations during flight.

\section{Chapter Overview}
This dissertation is organized into several chapters, each focusing on a different aspect of the research and development process of novelty detection systems for mission operations.
Throughout my time as a graduate student, I had many published works that contributed to this dissertation, and I have included them in the relevant chapters in their entirety with modifications to fit the overall narrative of the dissertation or add additional work done since their publication for the sake of completeness.
Any changes to these works are noted in the prelude to each chapter.

Chapter \ref{ch:msl}, Data Discovery Systems for Planetary Science,  was my first published work from \cite{horton2021integrating}, where I developed a software system to integrate novelty detection into the operations of MSL.
This work has a strong focus on background knowledge about novelty detection, as well as the development of a system to integrate novelty detection into the operations of MSL.
This, being one of the first projects I worked on, laid the foundation for my future work as I began to adapt the system for other instruments and missions.

Chapter \ref{ch:rst}, Anomaly Detection for the Roman Space Telescope Wide Field Instrument's Science Data Processing Pipeline, builds on the work done in Chapter \ref{ch:msl} and focuses on the development of a system to integrate novelty detection into the integration and testing (I\&T) of RST WFI.
With the support of the NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunity (NSTGRO) fellowship, I began working with the RST WFI I\&T Science Data Pipeline team to develop a pipeline that could identify snowballs and cosmic rays in their data. 
This work culminated in the publication of \cite{horton2024anomaly}, which describes our approach to identifying these anomalies. 

Following that, Chapter \ref{ch:spectra}, On-Board Science Data Quality Analysis using Anomaly Detection for ASTHROS, focuses on the development of an analysis system to integrate novelty detection into the operations of ASTHROS.
This chapter is the first of three that focuses on my work with ASTHROS, the primary instrument for this dissertation.
Chapter \ref{ch:spectra} is based on the publication \cite{horton2024board}, which describes our on-board approach to identifying anomalous spectra in the data collected by ASTHROS.
This is done by adapting the multispectral system developed in Chapter \ref{ch:msl} to work with the raw spectra collected by ASTHROS.

Chapter \ref{ch:carina}, Electron Density Mapping in the Carina Nebula, is a departure from the previous chapters on novelty detection and focuses on one of the science goals of ASTHROS, mapping Carina Nebula.
ASTHROS will be utilizing the ratio of [NII] 122 $\mu$m and 205 $\mu$m lines to map the electron density in the Carina Nebula.
This chapter explores new [NII] 205 $\mu$m data from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to create a map of electron density with Radio Recombination Line (RRL) data from the Deep Space Network (DSN) and Radio Continuum maps from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
While this might seem unrelated to the overall goals of this dissertation, a critical component for developing mission critical systems is understanding the users and their needs.
By becoming a member of the ASTHROS science team and having a vested interest in the science goals of the mission, I am able to better understand the mission's needs and develop a system that targets the scientist's pain points.
I intend to conduct more analysis and submit it to The Astrophysical Journal in the near future.

Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:readout}, ASTHROS Payload Readout System Design, focuses on the development of the payload readout system for ASTHROS.
This chapter is a user manual for every aspect of the readout system, from the low-level hardware drivers to the high-level interfaces used to control the entire payload.
The manual outlines the design decisions made during the development of the readout system.
The decisions made were in service of both the science goals of the mission as well as the goal of integrating novelty detection into the mission operations of ASTHROS.
For the sake of completeness, this chapter is long and detailed, as it is a standalone document for the ASTHROS team to understand how each system works and how to use it.

I end with conclusions and future work in Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion}.
This chapter summarizes the key findings of the dissertation and discusses to what extent I have covered the title: "Development, Implementation, and Impacts of Novelty Detection Systems for Mission Operations."
I evaluate what each of those three components in the title means and how they relate to the work done in this dissertation.
And finally, I discuss the future work that can be done to measure the impacts of these systems during a flight and improve the scientific software development process as a whole.
