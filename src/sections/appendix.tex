\chapter{ASTHROS Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 Setup Guide}
\label{readout/app:cm4_setup}
From a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS, we need to install the necessary packages to run the readout system.
The first step is to enable Secure Shell (SSH) so that we can remotely access the Raspberry Pi.
This can be done in the Raspberry Pi Configuration tool by enabling SSH in the Interfaces tab.
While we are in the interfaces tool, we mmust enable SPI and Remote GPIO. 
These are necessary to interface with the PMCC.

Next, we need to configure the networking interfaces. 
\texttt{eth0} is the wired interface to the rest of the readout network. 
We need a static IP for the CM4 to ensure that other devices on the network can easily find it.
In the network settings at the top right of the screen, we can select "Edit Connections" under Advanced Options. 
From there is "Wired connection 1" which is the default name for the wired interface.
Select the interface and navigate to the IPv4 Settings tab.
Change the method from "Automatic (DHCP)" to "Manual" and add the IP address, Netmask, and Gateway.
For ASTHROS, we have the IP addresses of all CM4s set to \texttt{192.168.1.13X} where \texttt{X} is uniquely assigned to each CM4.
The Netmask is set to \texttt{23} so we can access all devices on the \texttt{192.168.1.X} readout network as well as the \texttt{192.168.0.X} gondola network.
Finally, the Gateway is set to \texttt{192.168.1.1} when attached to the gondola and \texttt{192.168.1.101} when attached to the readout network.
This is because, when connected to a test bench, we utilize the NAS as our router to access other devices on the network.
When connected in flight configuration, we disable the NAS's router functionality and use the gondola's router instead.

Next, we need to configure the SPI interface to work with the PMCCs.
This process is different for Compute Module 5s (CM5s) as they have a different SPI driver and interfaces for the GPIO pins.
ASTHROS is currently in the process of upgrading to CM5s, but this documentation is focused on the setup for Compute Module 4s (CM4s).
The first step is to increase the SPI buffer size.
This is done by appending the following to the end of the \texttt{/boot/cmdline.txt} file:
\begin{verbatim}
    spidev.bufsiz=65536
\end{verbatim}
This sets the SPI buffer size to 64KB which is the maximum size to support the burst readout of the PMCCs.
For loading on boot, we need to add the SPI device to the \texttt{/etc/modules} file.
This is done by adding the following line to the file:
\begin{verbatim}
    spi_bcm2835
\end{verbatim}
Each of the CM4s will control up to four PMCCs, so we need to enable unique SPI busses for each PMCC.
This is done on the \texttt{/boot/config.txt} file by adding the following lines:
\begin{verbatim}
    dtoverlay=spi0-1cs
    dtoverlay=spi3-1cs
    dtoverlay=spi4-1cs
    dtoverlay=spi5-1cs
\end{verbatim}
This enables the SPI0, SPI3, SPI4, and SPI5 busses on the CM4.
While we could, in theory, only use two SPI busses and use the chip select lines to control two PMCCs on each bus, we decided to use a single chip select line for each PMCC to simplify the wiring harness and ensure our bandwidth is not saturated.

At this point, it is a good idea to reboot the CM4 to ensure that all changes have taken effect.
To verify the SPI busses are enabled, we check the \texttt{/dev} directory for the SPI devices which should be \texttt{/dev/spidevX.0} where \texttt{X} is the SPI bus number (0, 3, 4, or 5).
After rebooting and verifying the SPI has been set up, we recommend connecting the CM4 to the internet through a wireless hotspot in order to install the necessary libraries.
The first library we need to install is the \texttt{pigpio}.
This is a library that allows us to control the GPIO pins on the CM4 without needing root access.
To install the \texttt{pigpio} library, we need to run the following commands:
\begin{verbatim}
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install pigpio
\end{verbatim}
After installing the \texttt{pigpio} library, we need to enable the \texttt{pigpio} daemon to run on boot.
This is done by running the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
    sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
\end{verbatim}

Finally, we need to install the custom Python packages that we will use to control the PMCC.
First we need to clone the \texttt{PyMCC} repository from GitHub.
This is done by running the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
    git clone https://github.com/asthros/pymcc.git
\end{verbatim}
Because this is a private repository, you will need to enter your GitHub username and personal access token.
You will need to generate a personal access token on GitHub and use that as your password when prompted.
After cloning the repository, we need to install the Python packages.
This is done by running the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
    pip3 install -r pymcc/requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}
This will install all the necessary packages to run the \texttt{PyMCC} package.

Finally, we need to edit the hosts file on the CM4 to ensure that we can access the other devices on the readout network by name.
This is done by updating the \texttt{/etc/hosts} file with following the IP addresses and hostnames:
\begin{verbatim}
    192.168.1.102  Main Switch
    192.168.1.103  Sub Switch
    192.168.1.110  commander
    192.168.1.111  storage
    192.168.1.112  analysis
    192.168.1.120  spectra1A
    192.168.1.121  spectra1B
    192.168.1.122  spectra2A
    192.168.1.123  spectra2B
    192.168.1.130  varattio1
    192.168.1.131  varattio2
    192.168.1.132  varattio3
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Amplifier Chain Error Handling}
\label{readout/app:if_amp_errors}
Error codes for the amplifier chain are hard coded into the firmware of the Arduino.
Our driver code returns the following status codes whenever an error occurs in performing any read or write operation to the amplifier chain.
The hundreds digit of the error code indicates at what point in the control loop the error occurred.
In the case of a read, this value is 0 as there is only one operation performed.
In the case of a write, the value is 0 if an error occurred during the write operation and 1 if an error occurred during the subsequent read operation.

Our first response is what occurs during nominal operation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{X00} - No error
\end{itemize}
From here on, the errors are sorted by the system that is reporting the error.
Errors with data validation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{X01} - Bad Address Received
    \item \texttt{X02} - Bad Attenuation Received
\end{itemize}
Errors with connecting to the LCT4302:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{X11} - Buffer Overflow from LCT4302 Connection
    \item \texttt{X12} - NACK Received from LCT4302 connection
    \item \texttt{X13} - Bus Error or Arbitration Lost from LCT4302 connection
    \item \texttt{X14} - Timeout from LCT4302 connection
    \item \texttt{X15} - Unknown Error from LCT4302 connection
\end{itemize}
Errors connecting to the PCA9571:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{X21} - Buffer Overflow from PCA9571 Connection
    \item \texttt{X22} - NACK Received from PCA9571 connection
    \item \texttt{X23} - Bus Error or Arbitration Lost from PCA9571 connection
    \item \texttt{X24} - Timeout from PCA9571 connection
    \item \texttt{X25} - Unknown Error from PCA9571 connection
\end{itemize}
Errors disconnecting from the LCT4302:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{X31} - Buffer Overflow from LCT4302 Disconnection
    \item \texttt{X32} - NACK Received from LCT4302 disconnection
    \item \texttt{X33} - Bus Error or Arbitration Lost from LCT4302 disconnection
    \item \texttt{X34} - Timeout from LCT4302 disconnection
    \item \texttt{X35} - Unknown Error from LCT4302 disconnection
\end{itemize}
